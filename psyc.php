    <p><h3>What Is Psychotherapy?</h3>
    Also known as talk therapy, psychotherapy aims to help a person understand their feelings 
    and equip them to face new challenges, both in the present and the future. Psychotherapy is similar
     to counseling, and the two can overlap. However, the former tends to look more deeply, 
     addressing the underlying causes of a personâ€™s problems as well as how to solve them.
    </P>

    <p>
    To see positive results, a person will usually need to understand the need for change 
    and be willing to follow the treatment plan as the specialist advises. They will also 
    need to find a suitable therapist they can trust. Psychotherapy can help when depression, 
    low self-esteem, addiction, bereavement, or other factors leave a person feeling overwhelmed. 
    It can also help treat bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and certain other mental health conditions.
    </p>

    <p><h4>Who can benefit?</h4>
    Psychotherapy can help people in a range of situations. For example, it may benefit someone who:
    </p>
    <li>has overwhelming feelings of sadness or helplessness</li>
    <li>feels anxious most of the time</li>
    <li>has difficulty facing everyday challenges or focusing on work or studies</li>
    <li>is using drugs or alcohol in a way that is not healthful</li>
    <li>is at risk of harming themselves or others</li>
    <li>feels that their situation will never improve, despite receiving help from friends and family</li>
    <li>has experienced an abusive situation</li>
    <li>has a mental health condition, such as schizophrenia, that affects their daily life</li>

    <p><h4>Types</h4>
    There are several styles of and approaches to psychotherapy. The sections below will outline these in more detail.
    </p>
    <p><h5>Cognitive behavioral therapy</h5></p>
    <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is a short-term therapy technique that can help people find new ways
     to behave by changing their thought patterns.<br>

    <li>depression</li>

    <p><h3>How Effective Is Psychotherapy?</h3>
    One of the major criticisms leveled against psychotherapy calls into question its effectiveness. 
    In one early and frequently cited study, a psychologist named Hans Eysenck found that two-thirds 
    of participants either improved or recovered on their own within two years, regardless of whether
     they had received psychotherapy.

    <p><h4>How to Know If You Need Psychotherapy </h4>
    You might realize that psychotherapy can help with life's problems, but it can still be difficult
     to seek help or to even recognize when it is time to talk to a professional.
    <br>
    Some key signs that it might be time to see a psychotherapist include:
    </p>
    <li>The issue is causing significant distress or disruption in your life. If you feel that the 
    problem you are facing interrupts a number of important areas of your life including school,
     work, and relationships, it may be time to see if psychotherapy can help.</li><br>
    <li>You are relying on unhealthy or dangerous coping mechanisms. If you find yourself dealing 
    with your problem by smoking, drinking, overeating, or taking out your frustrations on others, 
    seeking assistance can help you find healthier and more beneficial coping strategies.</li><br>
    <li>Friends and family are concerned about your well-being. If it has reached a point where 
    other people are worried about your emotional health, it may be time to see if psychotherapy 
    can improve your psychological state.</li><br>
    <li>Nothing you have tried so far has helped. You've read self-help books, explored some 
    techniques you read about online, or even tried just ignoring the problem, yet things 
    just seem to be staying the same or even getting worse.</li>
