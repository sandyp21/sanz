    <p><h3>What Is Qi Gong?</h3>
    The literal translation of qi gong is “energy work.” It is an Asian form of yoga that has
    been around for thousands of years. Much of it is performed while standing, though there are
    a number of seated sets as well. There are hundreds of systems of qi gong that have come from
    various lineages, and many of them focus on different fields.Many are health oriented,
    while a separate group comes through the martial arts lineages.

    <p>
    These systems act to harness willpower, to focus, and to help practitioners channel their energy
    through their palms. There are also a number of systems from the temples and monasteries that are
    more focused on spiritual cultivation and depth of meditation. Some involve moving, and others 
    are visualization based. Almost all of them involve specialized breathing, which is coordinated
    with the activity at hand. The guiding principle of all these practices, however, is the 
    coordination of the eyes with the body movements, the focus of the mind, and the breath,
    especially for the moving practices. For the more passive, non- movement exercises, 
    we focus the vision inward and explore the inner realms as we guide the breath to various
    inner chambers.

    <p><h4>The Eyes in Qi Gong</h4>
    In the West, the eyes are considered the gateway to the soul and, in Taoist theory, are believed 
    to guide the shen, or the spirit. It is said that the qi (energy) follows the shen (spirit),
     and the blood and body fluids, in turn, then follow the qi. 
    </p>
 

    <p><h4>Body Movements in Qi Gong</h4>
    These are the actual sequenced movements of the qi gong exercises. Many of these follow the pathways
     of the energy meridians that run through the body. They also often trace the outer edges of our
      energy fields, smoothing and caressing the potency of the energy flow in our Light Body. 
      These movements often involve various degrees of exertion, and depending on the system you are 
      training in, they can actually be quite rigorous.
    </p>
    <p><h4>Mental Focus in Qi Gong</h4>
    This is a critical aspect of the practice and is the one that students most often overlook.
     Paying attention is a critical component to any energy work, as it engages the fire energy 
     of the heart and ties the spirit in with the actions at hand. The ancients say the linking of
      attention and intention creates mastery in life. Here, we are asked to focus on the action at 
      hand and to stay engaged in the body movements, tracking them with the eyes. Doing so demands 
      our mental focus and presence, and the reward is immense. This aspect also draws on the yi, 
      or shen, of the earth element. 
    </p>
    <p><h4>Breath in Qi Gong</h4>
    It is the vital breath that is said to circulate through the various meridians, and it is the
     energy from the air, if you recall, that mixes with the food qi to create the functional energy 
     of our body. The coordination of breath with body movements and attention drives energy through 
     the designated pathways and opens blockages. We use breath not only to open these pathways but 
     also to gather and store the breath and energy in specific reservoirs (called dantiens) in the body.
      An adept student learns to extract vital energy from the air through breathwork.

    <p><h3>What is the goal of Qi Gong?</h3>
    The goal of qi gong isn’t an addition process; it is more a subtraction process. The more we can
     get out of our own way, the more we can let the universal flow of energy move through us.
      We become an agent of its goodwill, and we take our rightful place in eternity. This is not in 
      some far-off heaven but here and now. Qi gong helps us wake up to the living, breathing moment 
      in which we can finally take part. An important aspect in “getting out of the way” is reconciling 
      the stuck energies in the “horizontal axis” of grief, anger, and frustration. This horizontal
       soul axis of emotions is intimately involved in the rising and falling trends of our mental and 
       emotional upheavals. It is simultaneously tied to the cycle of life and all the trials and
        tribulations of the soul. It is important to not be deferential about this and to be engaged 
        in the process of reconciling imbalances on this axis.  
    </P>

    <p><h4>The Different Types of Qi Gong Practice </h4>
    There is a yin and a yang aspect to everything, including the actual energetic practice. 
    We studied the various types of energy earlier. Now, some of that information will come to 
    light a bit more. The nutritive qi and the defensive qi are the main types of energy running 
    through our body. They tend to our cells and service our myriad physiological needs.
     For these types of qi, there are practices designed to emphasize one or the other. 
     In fact, there are also practices designed to enhance shen, or spirit, as well as
      other internal practices designed to cultivate and refine essence and awaken the spirit within. 
      Here are the designations of the various qi gong practices:
