            <p><h3>What Is Massage Therapy?</h3>
                Massage therapy is used to help manage a health condition or enhance wellness.
                It involves manipulating the soft tissues of the body. Massage has been practiced 
                in most cultures, both Eastern and Western, throughout human history, and was one 
                of the earliest tools that people used to try to relieve pain.
            </P>

            <p>
                Massage therapists work in a variety of settings, including private offices, hospitals, 
                nursing homes, studios, and sport and fitness facilities. Some also travel to patients'
                homes or workplaces. They usually try to provide a calm, soothing environment.

            <p><h3>Types of Massage Therapy?</h3>
                    The term “massage therapy” includes many techniques. The most common form of massage therapy
                    in Western countries is called Swedish or classical massage; it is the core of most massage 
                    training programs. Other styles include sports massage, clinical massage to accomplish specific
                    goals such as releasing muscle spasms, and massage traditions derived from Eastern cultures, 
                    such as Shiatsu and Tuina.

            <p><h4>Swedish Massage Therapy</h4>
                Swedish massage is the standard type of massage offered in most clinics, gyms, spas, and wellness 
                centers. Using lotion or oil, massage therapists typically begin with broad general strokes and 
                then transition to specific strokes to address problem areas
            </p>

            <p><h4>Aromatherapy Massage</h4>
                An aromatherapy massage is a Swedish massage with scented plant oils (known as essential oils) 
                added to the massage oil. Extracted from flowers and other plant parts, essential oils offer a 
                pleasing scent and are believed to have healing properties. Lavender for instance, has been 
                found to promote relaxation. Although different essential oils may be selected to address 
                specific needs, the therapist typically uses pre-blended oils to relax, energize, or uplift.
            </p>

            <p>
                The soothing effects of aromatherapy massage may benefit a variety of conditions, including 
                depression, insomnia, certain digestive disorders, and pain.
            </p>
            <p><h4>Hot Stone Massage</h4>
                As the name implies, a hot stone massage uses heated stones. The massage therapist places warm,
                smooth stones on specific points on the body and also holds the stones while giving the massage.
                The stones are usually basalt (a volcanic rock that retains heat well).
            </p>

            <p><h4>Deep Tissue Massage</h4>
                Deep tissue massage is a focused, therapeutic massage that targets muscle knots 
                (also known as "adhesions") and specific problem areas in the deeper layers of muscle and 
                connective tissue. Using deliberate, slow strokes or friction across the grain of the muscle,
                the therapist can address chronic tight or painful muscles, repetitive strain, postural problems,
                or injuries.
            </p>

            <p><h4>Shiatsu Massage</h4>
                A form of Japanese bodywork, shiatsu massage involves localized pressure using the therapist's fingers
                (or sometimes hands and elbows), applied in a rhythmic sequence along the body. Each point is held for 
                about two to eight seconds.
            </p>

            <p><h4>Thai Massage</h4>
                A unique blend of assisted yoga, passive stretching, and pressing massage movements, Thai massage is 
                more energizing than other forms of massage. It's a little bit like yoga without doing the work, 
                as the therapist moves and stretches you in a sequence of postures, usually on a mat on the floor.
            </p>

            <p><h4>Reflexology</h4>
                Like having your feet worked on? The therapist uses finger pressure and techniques such as 
                kneading and rubbing to promote relaxation and healing in the body. Reflexology is based on
                "reflex areas" on the hands and feet, whose energy is believed to be connected to organs and
                other body parts.
