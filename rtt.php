    <p><h3>What Is RTT®?</h3>
        Rapid Transformational Therapy® embraces many of the positive aspects of hypnosis 
        and hypnotherapy that are known to produce a transformative effect on clients, 
        including the use of trance and hypnotic conditioning.
    </P>

    <p>
        However, RTT® goes beyond hypnosis, diagnosing what works with clients to build 
        a new therapeutic approach. Unlike traditional hypnotherapy, RTT® does not rely 
        solely on positive reinforcement.
    </p>

    <p>
        While using correct, up-to-date, and relevant language when talking to yourself is 
        certainly a part of any transformation, it serves as more of a reinforcement of
        breakthroughs rather than the catalyst. RTT® therapists could reach breakthroughs 
        via hypnosis that would not be possible if they were simply trying to access the 
        subconscious mind via altered language and self-talk.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your RTT® therapist is equipped with an array of techniques and tools that are crucial,
        not just in teaching you how to communicate with your subconscious mind but also directly 
        accessing and fixing whatever blocks may be there. Central to that is the ability to transform 
        many clients in a single session.

    <p><h3>How Does RTT® Work?</h3>
        Rapid Transformational Therapy negotiates with the subconscious using a combination of tools,
        depending on the client goal and varying individualities,
        to aid the client in making key self realisations that helps them to let go and move forward.
    </P>

    <p>
    Using RTT, clients with a wide range of issues usually achieve huge beneficial and permanent change, 
    often within 1 -3 sessions, removing the need for continuous therapy sessions.
